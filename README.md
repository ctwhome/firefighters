<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

This project describes a decision support system for emergency crews. It aims to design an application framed within the context of aid to decision-making for emergency services as part of a network visible ad-hoc communications designed in collaboration with Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Carlos III University of Madrid and the firehouse of Fuenlabrada. The design is aimed for use in fire brigades, however, could be extrapolated to other intervention services such as police, emergency hospital services, Summa 112, etc.

The application must show the net to all those involved in an emergency situation. To present this information, the application will run on a PC-type tablet PC that displays a map centered on the location of the emergency. On the same map, shall include the exact location of each party involved in the emergency and the emergency personnel and vehicles. In addition, both staff and the vehicles involved will have their own data as sensors of oxygen level and heart rate monitors, among others, and important information points.

Also, the application is available in the form of several utilities measurement tools on the digital map, weather, adding custom marks, risk zoning, consultation documentation, internet access via an integrated web browser and other tools that will be explained herein.
The application will be developed under the framework Flex (Adobe Company, INC. 2012) for ActionScript3 (object-oriented language and events) being executed by the virtual machine platform Adobe Air present in desktop and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones.
